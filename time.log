  I discussed my solution with: Sam Laing

  Once again I fell victim to the rush job, luckily I had my own self imposed deadline as my mom is visting me the day it is due so I had to finish a day early. Although more tedious at times, I felt that this pset was easier than the last. Using STL made it so I could be a little more careless, knowing I won't have any memory issues. I do believe it is not the most effiecient version it could be, I did not go through every data structure because of my lack of time, but it works. It has also been some time since I have taken 223 so I'm not as sharp as I'd to be.
